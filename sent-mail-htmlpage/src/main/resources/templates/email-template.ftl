									Dear [Sangram Das],
									<br>

Happy birthday to you! As a developer, I know that birthdays are a special occasion to celebrate another year of life and reflect on the journey so far. It's also a great time to look forward to what's to come and set new goals.

As you blow out the candles on your cake, I hope you're filled with excitement for all the projects you'll develop in the coming year. May your code be efficient and bug-free, and may you always be inspired to create something amazing.

On this special day, take a break from coding and treat yourself to something fun. You deserve it! And when you're ready to get back to work, I'll be here to support you.

Wishing you a happy birthday filled with joy, laughter, and all the things that make life worth celebrating.
Cheers,
<br>
[Developer Coomunity]
